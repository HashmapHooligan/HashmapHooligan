- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HashmapHooligan or AlgorhtmArtist
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all kinds of games development stuff with a focus on algorithms, optimization and visualization
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity and C#
- ðŸ›‘ My projects are all private, since I am using proprietary libraries
- âš¡ Fun fact: I haven't programmed for years and relearned my love for it with Unity
